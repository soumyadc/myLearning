# Mutex and Semaphore:
Mutual exclusive lock.
if a critical section is locked with mutex then only one thread can entered into that critical section at any given point of time.
But it doesnot tell which thread can come first or later, it cannot dictate the order of thread execution on that critical section.

This can be done via semaphore.
