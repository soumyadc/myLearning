# myLearning
This repository is to store my learnings and understanding on various areas of technology,
coding practices, architecturse, dev-notes, settings etc for future reference.

This is completely for my personal use. 
If it helps someone anyways, it will be nice.
But if it violates any licenses in any ways, it is completely unintentional, please notify me if such cases happens. I will remove that content.

But, again this repository is completly for my personal use, and kind of note taking and storage place for my personal use.
