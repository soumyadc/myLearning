# myLearning
This repository is to story my learnings and understanding on various areas of technology,
coding practice, architecture, dev-notes, settings etc for future reference.

This is completely for my personal use. 
If it helps someone anyways, I will be glad.
If it violates any licenses in any case, it is completely unintentional, please notify me if such cases happens. I will remove the content.

But, again this repository is completly for my personal use, and kind of note taking and storage place for my personal use.
